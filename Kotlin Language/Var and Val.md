- Var is used to declare a **mutable variable**. A mutable variable is a variable that can be changed or that can be reassigned in the course of the program.

- Val is used to declare **immutable variables**. Once a value is assigned to a variable with the val keyword, it cannot be altered or reassigned throughout the program. 
Val is similar to the **final keyword** in Java.
