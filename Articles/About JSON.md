## JSON

- It stands for Javascript object notation.

**JSON Format**

```
  X = 
{
    "firstName" : "Utkarsh"
    "age" : 22
    "lastName" : "Saxena"
}
```
<br>

- In the code above, firstName is key while Utkarsh is pair.
- All keys **have to be string** while pair can hold any sort of value.
- JSON is a light weight format which is used for communicating over HTTP.
- Using **json.parse()** will create an object out of it with key and value pairs. We don't need to write separate parsers.

- Comments are not allowed in JSON (since it deals with objects).
